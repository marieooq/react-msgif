I launched this web app on [Product Hunt](https://www.producthunt.com/posts/msgif) on February 7th, 2020.üéâ<br>
Thankfully, I got a lot of feedback and also some inquiries about making it OSS.<br>
I decided to make it OSS eventually because I am not going to do this for living and spare a lot of time to maintain this project. <br>
